#Hate About You

I hate the way you talk to me and the way you cut your hair.

I hate the way you drive my car. I hate it when you stare.

I hate your big dumb combat boots and the way you read my mind.

I hate you so much it makes me rhyme.

I hate it-- I hate the way you're always right.

I hate it when you lie.

I hate it when you make me laugh, even worse when you make me cry.

I hate it when you're not around and the fact you didn't call.

But mostly, I hate the way I don't hate you, not event close,

not even at all.
